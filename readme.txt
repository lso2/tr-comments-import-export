Export and import WordPress comments with filtering and status mapping. Perfect for site migrations and comment backups.

== Description ==

The Comments Export/Import Manager is a powerful tool for WordPress administrators who need to backup, transfer, or manage comments across WordPress installations. Whether you're migrating to a new site, implementing spam filtering workflows, or creating comment backups, this plugin provides the flexibility and control you need.

**Key Features:**

* **Flexible Export Options** - Choose which comment statuses to export (Approved, Pending, Spam, Trash)
* **Smart Import Mapping** - Map imported comment statuses to new statuses during import
* **CSV Format** - Industry-standard CSV format for maximum compatibility
* **Duplicate Prevention** - Automatically skips comments with existing IDs to prevent duplicates
* **Complete Data Preservation** - Exports all comment metadata including author info, timestamps, and content
* **Status Statistics** - View current comment counts by status before export/import
* **User-Friendly Interface** - Clean, intuitive admin interface with helpful descriptions

**Perfect For:**

* Site migrations and transfers
* Spam filtering workflows (export comments, filter through external services, re-import)
* Creating comment backups before major changes
* Moving comments between staging and production sites
* Bulk comment status changes via external processing

**How It Works:**

1. **Export**: Select comment statuses to include and download as CSV
2. **Process**: Optionally process the CSV file with external tools or services
3. **Import**: Upload the CSV and map original statuses to new ones
4. **Verify**: Check import results and comment statistics

The plugin is lightweight, secure, and follows WordPress coding standards. All operations are performed with proper nonce verification and capability checks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/tr-comments-import-export` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to Comments â†’ Export/Import to access the plugin features

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What comment data is exported? =

The plugin exports all comment data including: comment ID, post ID, author name, email, URL, IP address, dates, content, karma, approval status, user agent, comment type, parent comment, and user ID.

= Can I export only specific comment statuses? =

Yes! You can choose to export any combination of Approved, Pending, Spam, and Trash comments using the checkboxes in the export section.

= What happens to comment statuses during import? =

You have full control over status mapping. For each original status (Approved, Pending, Spam, Trash), you can choose what status it should become when imported.

= Will importing create duplicate comments? =

No. The plugin automatically checks for existing comment IDs and skips any comments that already exist in your database.

= Can I use this with large numbers of comments? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to handle large comment datasets efficiently. However, very large imports may take some time to process depending on your server configuration.

= Is the CSV format compatible with other tools? =

Yes, the plugin uses standard CSV format that can be opened and edited with Excel, Google Sheets, or any CSV-compatible application.
